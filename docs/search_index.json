Smith March 5th, 2020 1 Introduction 1.1 Objective Demonstrate the functionality provided by the mmir R-package for calculating biological metrics for the development and/or use in an MMI or IBI. 1.2 What is an MMI? Multi-Metric Indices (MMIs) or Indices of Biotic Integrity (IBIs) are models that summarize multiple aspects of a biological community of interest (e.g., richness, diversity, relative abundance, tolerance, and functional feeding group) into a single numeric or categorical value representing ecological condition. considered a robust measure of water quality becuase it represents more than a snapshot in time have been around for nearly 40 years 1.3 Need MMIs are widely used by U.S. federal and state agencies to assess water quality but there is no R-package available to simplify and standardize metric calculations.
